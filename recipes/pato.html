    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Magret de pato</strong> is a dish made with <strong>the breast of a duck raised for foie gras</strong>, characterized by its juicy meat and <strong>a layer of fat that browns when cooked</strong>. It is prepared by scoring the skin in a diamond pattern and cooking it over medium heat, allowing the fat to melt and form a crispy crust while the inside remains pink and tender.</p>
    <p>Once cooked, the magret is sliced thinly and is often served with sweet-and-sour sauces, such as red wine reduction, red fruits, or orange. It is a refined and tasty dish, where the balance between juicy meat and crispy skin makes it an <em>exquisite option</em> to enjoy an elegant and flavorful preparation.</p>
